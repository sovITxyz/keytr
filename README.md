# keytr

Passkey login for Nostr. Encrypt your nsec with a WebAuthn passkey, publish to relays, decrypt on any device. Implements [NIP-K1](nip/nip-k1.md).

## How it works

Register a passkey, encrypt your nsec, publish the ciphertext to Nostr relays. On any device with the synced passkey, tap to decrypt — no npub input needed, no localStorage, no manual key copying.

keytr supports two encryption modes:

- **PRF mode** — the passkey's PRF extension produces a deterministic secret for key derivation. Strongest security (hardware-bound), but requires PRF-capable authenticators.
- **KiH mode** (Key-in-Handle) — a random 256-bit encryption key is stored in the passkey's `user.id` field. Works with **all** authenticators, including those without PRF support (e.g., Firefox Android, older security keys). Always 1 biometric prompt.

Both modes use the same crypto pipeline: HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM. The unified `setup()` API tries PRF first and falls back to KiH automatically.

```
PRF mode:  Passkey PRF → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM → kind:31777 (v=1) → relay
KiH mode:  Random key in user.id → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM → kind:31777 (v=3) → relay
```

Cross-client login works via a [federated gateway model](docs/architecture.md#federated-gateway-model) — any domain can authorize a set of Nostr clients to share passkey access using WebAuthn [Related Origin Requests](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-related-origins). The two official gateways (`keytr.org` on Cloudflare, `nostkey.org` on Hostinger) trust each other bidirectionally, so a passkey registered under either rpId works on both sites and all authorized client origins.

## Install

```bash
npm install @sovit.xyz/keytr
```

## Quick start

### Setup (new user — unified API)

```typescript
import { setup, publishKeytrEvent } from '@sovit.xyz/keytr'
import { finalizeEvent } from 'nostr-tools/pure'

// Tries PRF first, falls back to KiH if authenticator doesn't support PRF
const { credential, encryptedBlob, eventTemplate, nsecBytes, npub, mode } = await setup({
  userName: 'alice',
  userDisplayName: 'Alice',
})

console.log(`Registered in ${mode} mode`) // 'prf' or 'kih'

// Sign and publish
const signedEvent = finalizeEvent(eventTemplate, nsecBytes)
await publishKeytrEvent(signedEvent, ['wss://relay.damus.io'])
```

### Login (discoverable — no npub needed)

```typescript
import { discover } from '@sovit.xyz/keytr'

// Browser shows passkeys, user picks one, mode auto-detected from userHandle
const { nsecBytes, npub, pubkey, mode } = await discover(
  ['wss://relay.damus.io'],
  { rpId: 'keytr.org' }
)

console.log(`Logged in via ${mode} mode`) // 'prf' or 'kih'
```

### Login (known pubkey — PRF mode only)

```typescript
import { loginWithKeytr, fetchKeytrEvents } from '@sovit.xyz/keytr'

const events = await fetchKeytrEvents(pubkey, ['wss://relay.damus.io'])
const { nsecBytes, npub } = await loginWithKeytr(events)
```

The previous `setupKeytr()` and `discoverAndLogin()` functions remain available for backward compatibility.

## Compatibility

keytr requires [discoverable credentials](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client-side-discoverable-credential). PRF mode additionally requires the [PRF extension](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#prf-extension). KiH mode works without PRF.

### Browsers

| Browser | Min Version | PRF Mode | KiH Mode | Discoverable Login | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Chrome (Desktop) | 116+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Chrome (Android) | 116+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Edge | 116+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Chromium-based |
| Safari | 18+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | PRF discovery requires two biometric prompts; KiH completes in one |
| Firefox | 122+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Firefox Android | — | No | Yes | Yes | No PRF support — KiH fallback works |

### Authenticators

| Authenticator | PRF Mode | KiH Mode | Notes |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------|
| iCloud Keychain | Yes | Yes | macOS 15+ / iOS 18+ |
| Google Password Manager | Yes | Yes | Android 14+ / Chrome 116+ |
| Windows Hello | Yes | Yes | Windows 11 25H2+ (Feb 2026 update) |
| YubiKey 5 (firmware 5.7+) | Yes | Yes | PRF via `hmac-secret` bridge |
| YubiKey 5 (firmware < 5.7) | No | Yes | KiH fallback works |
| 1Password | Yes | Yes | PRF supported across platforms |
| Bitwarden | Yes | Yes | PRF supported since 2026.1.1 (Chromium-based browsers) |
| Dashlane | Beta | Yes | PRF in beta (browser extension only); KiH as stable fallback |
| Older security keys | No | Yes | KiH works with any WebAuthn authenticator |

### Federated gateways

Cross-client login via [Related Origin Requests](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-related-origins) requires additional browser support:

| Browser | Related Origins | Min Version |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Chrome | Yes | 128+ |
| Edge | Yes | 128+ |
| Safari | Yes | 18+ |
| Firefox | No | Positive standards position (March 2026); no implementation timeline |

Use `checkPrfSupport()` at runtime to detect PRF capability. The unified `setup()` API tries PRF first and automatically falls back to KiH when PRF is unavailable — no conditional logic needed in calling code.

## Security properties

| Property | PRF Mode | KiH Mode |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Hardware-bound** | Yes — PRF output requires authenticator + biometric | Partially — key stored in passkey credential |
| **Origin-bound** | Yes — different domains get different PRF output | Yes — passkey still bound to rpId |
| **AAD-bound** | `"keytr" \|\| 0x01 \|\| credentialId` | `"keytr" \|\| 0x03 \|\| credentialId` |
| **Cross-mode isolation** | AAD version byte prevents KiH blobs decrypting as PRF | AAD version byte prevents PRF blobs decrypting as KiH |
| **No server trust** | Relay is a dumb store, encryption is end-to-end | Same |
| **Memory hygiene** | Keys zeroed after use | Same |

KiH mode trades PRF's hardware-bound key derivation for universal authenticator compatibility. The encryption key is a random 256-bit value stored in the passkey's `user.id` field — still protected by the passkey's biometric/PIN requirement, but extractable by the authenticator (unlike PRF output, which never leaves the hardware). Now that most major password managers support PRF, KiH primarily serves as an automatic fallback for environments where PRF is unavailable (e.g., Firefox Android, older security keys).
